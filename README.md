# Packet_Loss_Prediction_In_Network_Flows
A SVM Model to predict packet loss, utilized across my home network. 
Inspired by ["A Machine Learning Approach to TCP Throughput
Prediction" by Mirza et al.](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/sigm07_final.pdf) and ["A Machine Learning Approach for Packet Loss Prediction in Science
Flows" by Giannakou et al.](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~peisert/research/2020-FGCS-PredictRetransmit.pdf)
