# Packet_Loss_Prediction_In_Network_Flows
A SVM Model to predict packet loss, utilized across my home network. 
Inspired by ["A Machine Learning Approach to TCP Throughput
Prediction"](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/pub/sigm07_final.pdf) by Mirza et al. and ["A Machine Learning Approach for Packet Loss Prediction in Science
Flows"](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~peisert/research/2020-FGCS-PredictRetransmit.pdf) by Giannakou et al.
